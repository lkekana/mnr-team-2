## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing

1. *Authentication Flow*
   bash
   # Navigate to login page
   http://localhost:3000/login
   
   # Enter any email/password and click "Sign in"
   # Should redirect to dashboard with loading state
   

2. *User Profile Management*
   bash
   # Navigate to profile page
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/profile
   
   # Test form validation and submission
   # Verify success message and field updates
   # Test notification threshold slider (1-20)
   # Test email notifications toggle
   

3. *Alerts Dashboard*
   bash
   # Navigate to alerts page
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/alerts
   
   # Test filtering by status (All, Active, Pending, Resolved)
   # Test sorting by date, title, status
   # Try resolving active alerts
   # Try deleting alerts with confirmation
   

4. *Monitored Destinations CRUD*
   bash
   # Navigate to destinations page
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/tests
   
   # Test all CRUD operations:
   # - CREATE: Click "Add Destination" → fill form → submit
   # - READ: View destinations table with ID, location, risk level, last checked
   # - UPDATE: Click "Edit" → modify data → save changes
   # - DELETE: Click "Delete" → confirm deletion
   # - SEARCH: Use search box to filter destinations
   # - FILTER: Filter by risk level (Low, Medium, High, etc.)
